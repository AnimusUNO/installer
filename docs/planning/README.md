# Planning Documentation

This folder contains project planning documents and implementation strategies for the Sanctum system.

## Contents

### Database & Schema Planning
- **`ui-database-schema-planning.md`** - **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN** for database schema (references master schema)

### Integration Planning
- **`flask-chat-integration-plan.md`** - Plan for integrating the Flask chat bridge with the control UI

### Installation Planning
- **`core-installation-planning.md`** - Core system installation planning and strategy

### System Configuration Planning
- **`system_settings_planning.md`** - Planning for system settings and user management functionality

### UI Design Planning
- **`design for web interface.md`** - Web interface design planning and specifications

## Usage

These documents serve as the implementation roadmap for:
- **Database schema development** (phased implementation)
- Feature integration planning
- Installation and deployment strategies
- UI/UX design decisions

## Maintenance

Planning documents should be updated when:
- Implementation priorities change
- New requirements are identified
- Technical approaches are modified
- Project timelines are adjusted

## Relationship to Reference Docs

Planning documents build upon the reference documentation:
- **Use master schema** from `../reference/registry_schema.md`
- Reference API specifications for integration planning
- **Reference database schema** rather than duplicating definitions
- Follow installation criteria from reference docs

**Important**: The `ui-database-schema-planning.md` is an **implementation plan** that references the master schema. It does not duplicate schema definitions but provides phased implementation steps.

Keep planning documents aligned with current reference documentation to ensure consistency.
